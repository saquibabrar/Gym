            "Just like every other skinny teenager, even I was tired of the criticism I used to receive so often; that I decided to bring a change in my physique and started working out at the age of 15. Slowly but surely, I saw excellent results! Since then, it has become an effective obsession and turned into my passion project."</p></h10>
